## Can you believe it?
1. **What is the story about?**
The story is about a Swedish man named Peter Skyllberg who survived 60 days trapped in his car in the snow, eating only handfuls of snow to stay hydrated.

2. **What additional information are you curious about?**

   * **Who discovered him?**
     He was discovered by a passerby on a snowmobile while they were clearing the roadway.

   * **Where was he stuck?**
     He was stuck on a secluded forest road in northern Sweden.

   * **How did he manage to survive?**
     He managed to survive by consuming snow for hydration and trying to stay warm in a sleeping bag.

   * **When did they find him?**
     He was located on a Friday, 60 days after he became trapped.

   * **What did he use to keep warm?**
     At first, he relied on the warmth from his car’s engine until the fuel was exhausted, and then he depended on his sleeping bag.

   * **Why are some experts doubtful?**
     Some experts are doubtful because it’s uncommon for someone to survive 60 days without food, and they wonder if he might have gone into a state resembling hibernation.

3. **Are you able to get answers to all your inquiries? What are your thoughts on why certain experts have doubts?**

Yes, the article answers most inquiries regarding who discovered him, where he was trapped, and how he survived. Some experts have doubts because it’s unusual for a person to endure such severe conditions without food for an extended period, and the notion of human hibernation seems far-fetched to them.

## Writing
The Little Prince is this cool book written by Antoine something (i do not remember his last name), a French author, back in 1943. It’s about this little prince who travels to different planets and meets all sorts of strange characters. Each person he meets teaches him something, and the whole story is full of deep stuff about life, love, and growing up.

The story starts with a pilot who crashes his plane in the desert and meets the little prince. The prince asks him to draw a sheep, and that’s how they start chatting. The prince tells the pilot about his journey and the people he’s met, like a king, a vain dude, a drunk guy, a lamplighter, and a geographer. Each of them kind of represents different parts of society, and the book pokes fun at how adults often care too much about stuff like power and appearances.

One of the best parts of The Little Prince is when the prince says, "What is essential is invisible to the eye." Basically, it’s a reminder that the most important things in life just like love, friendship, and real connections are not things you can see or touch. The prince learns this with his rose, realizing she is special, even though she looks like any other rose.

Even though the book seems like it’s for kids, it’s actually got a lot of deep stuff for anyone. It’s all about remembering what really matters in life—love, real connections, and seeing the world through the eyes of a child.
