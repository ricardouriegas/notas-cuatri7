# Auxilary Verbs
Here we have be, do and have. (Used to help the main verb, making and emphasis or a question)
1. In tag questions
   - it's cool today, isn't it?

2. In short answers
   - "Do you like kpap?" "Yes, i do"

3. In reply questions. Are used to show that listener is paying attenrion and is interested.
   - "I've bought you a present" "Have you? How nice"

# Full verbs
Full verbs are all the rest of the verbs left that mean an action (mainly). We can also have _do_, _be_ and _have_ as full verbs ando not auxiliaries (used when we want to emphasize the action)
- I **dont (auxiliar) do (full verb)** excercise
- They **'re(aux) having(full verb)** an argument
- Have (aux) you **been (full verb)** to school today?

# Modal axuliaries verbs
The _help_ other verbs. They are different from be, do and have because they have their own meaning. They are used to show how certain the speaker is about the action.
- You **must** try harder
- **Can** you swim?
- I **can** speak english

# English tense usage
English tenses have two elements of meaning:
Time and Aspect

## Time
1. The time reffered to is usual obvius from the context
   - English people **eat** a lot of fish (all the time)
   - I **'ll see** you later (future)

2. Sometimes a present tense form can refer to the future.
   - I'm going out tonight
   - The train leveas at 10:30 tomorrow

3. Sometimes a past tense form can refer to the present in meaning.
   - I wish i **could** help you, but i can't

# Simple aspect 

1. Describes on action or fact that is seen to be complete or permanent, often an action or event that happens repeatedly and consistently.
   - the sun **rises** in the east
   - she **has** red hair

2. The verbs that rarely use the coninuous aspect express states that are seen to be permanent and not subject to frequent change.

   - Verbs of the mind: know, undestand, believe, think, mean
   - Verbs of emotions: love, hate, like, prefer, care
   - Verbs of possession: have, own, belong, possess
   - Certain other verbs: cost, need, contain, depend

3. Expresses a completed action
   - She **read** fice books while she was on vacation

# Continuous aspect
1. Expresses the ongoing nature of an activity
   - i **'m staying** with my friends until i fing an apartment
2. The activity may not be complete
   - Who **'s been drinking** my chai latte?
3. The actions of some verbs, by definition, lasts a long time, for example, live, work, play. The continuous gives these `actions limited duration and makes them temporary.
   - Sergio **is living** in Seattle while he **is working** on his new book
4. Thee action of some verbs lasta short time **(lose, break, crash)** they are often found in the simple aspect.
   - She **'s cut** her finger 
   - He **hit** me
In the continuous the action of these verbs seems longer or habitual.
   - I **'ve been cutting** the grass
   - He **was hitting** me 

# Perfect aspect
1. The action is completed before another time
   - **Have** you ever **been** to the USA?
   - When i arrived, Peter **had left**
2. The exact time of the verb action is not important. The perfect aspect refers to indefinite time.
   - **Have** you **seen** my wallet anywhere? I've lost it
The exception is the Past Perfect, which can refer to a definite time.
   - She **had visited** her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in whit them in 1996.
