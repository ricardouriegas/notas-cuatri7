## Opening

_Music and intro stuff_

- **Alex**: Welcome, welcome, everyone.
- **Joshua**: We’re glad to have you here. I’m Miguelito Turrubiates, and this is "The News with Alex and Miguelito."
- **Alex**: That’s right! Today, we have some really interesting stories for you, so sit tight. You won’t want to miss what’s coming.
- **Joshua**: We’re going to jump right in with our first segment. Over to Nesquik for an important update on a recurring issue at the school.

### Cafeteria Overcrowding Report

_Location: Outside the cafeteria_

- **Hector**: Good morning, afternoon, evening, or night. I’m Nesquik, reporting live from the entrance of the school cafeteria, where every single day at 10:35 a.m., we witness the same overwhelming sight—crowds of students gathering and forming a line that seems to stretch on forever. 

Now, let’s talk about the numbers. According to data gathered from the past two weeks, the cafeteria serves an average of 200 students within the first 15 minutes of the break. The problem is, the cafeteria’s maximum capacity is just around 20, leading to severe congestion, long wait times, and a lot of frustration. 

If you stand here at this very spot each day, you can observe the line getting longer, the students getting more impatient, and the staff scrambling to keep up with orders. The scene is chaotic, and this situation has been getting worse as more students opt to eat on campus. 

Solutions like opening more food kiosks around campus or implementing staggered lunch times have been proposed, but so far, no significant action has been taken. For now, students are stuck battling the lunch rush. That’s the latest from the cafeteria, where the problem persists. Back to you in the studio, Alex and Miguelito.

## Comeback to the studio

_Music and transition_

- **Alex**: Thank you for that report, Nesquik. Clearly, something needs to be done about this. Hopefully, we’ll see some changes soon.
- **Joshua**: Absolutely, Alex. Now let’s shift gears and take a look at the weather. Ramona, what do you have for us today?

### Dramatic Weather Forecast

_Music and transition_

- **Uriegas**: hi. I’m Ramona from the weather station, and hold on your hats because this week’s forecast is nothing short of dramatic.

    Wednesday will start off nice and easy with a perfect sunny day. Clear skies, mild temperatures, and just the right breeze. It’s the kind of weather where you might think everything’s gonna be alright.

    But then... Thursday hits. Brace yourselves, because it’s going to feel like the end of days. We’re talking about thunderstorms, torrential rain, and hailstones the size of golf balls—maybe even tennis balls if we’re unlucky. Winds are expected to reach speeds of up to 60 miles per hour, so I suggest you secure anything that could fly away... including yourselves!

    Friday isn’t looking any better. We’re predicting a major cold front that’s going to bring temperatures down into the 30s. If you thought you were done with your winter clothes, think again! Frost is expected to cover most of the region by morning.

    And, as for Saturday, if we survive the first half of the week, we'll be rewarded with "El juancho compadre de todos los santos" marathon on TV. So stay indoors, and in tone because it’s going to be a great marathon to see.

    So dont worry about the other days of the week, they will be just fine if you have enough money to buy a new house. Back to you, Alex and Miguelito.
