- **Alex**: Andres navi reporting a tragic event that just happend.
Yesterday i was at the school when suddenly something just hit inside my stomach, i felt like i was going to throw up, i was scared, i was terrified, i was about to experience the worst thing i could ever felt.

_scene change to start telling the story_

- **Alex**: Over the past week the school bathrooms have been closed due to a unknown reason, but i didnt knew that. So just about to explode i ran to the bathroom to just found out that it was closed. I ran to the first floor but it was closed too, the only thing i could do was run to the other building and hope, all was just hope.

_scene change to the other building_

- **Alex**: I enter the bathroom and i felt the heaven, i was saved, i was happy, i experienced the best thing i could ever imagine.
Hope you dont have to experience the same thing i did, today the bathrooms still closed like always, so be careful.
Thats my report, see you next time.
