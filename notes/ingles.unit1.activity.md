1. Work in pairs. What is strange about these sentences? What should they be?
   1. **"Columbus has discovered America"**  
      - "Columbus **discovered** America."
   
   2. **"I traveled all my life. I went everywhere"**  
      - "i **have traveled** all my life. I **have been** everywhere."
   
   3. **"I've learned English"**  
      - "i **learned** English" or "I've **been learning** English"
   
   4. **"Ouch, I've been cutting my thumb"** 
      - "ouch, I **cut** my thumb."

2. Which of these verb forms can change from simple to continuous? What is the change in meaning?
   
   1. **"What do you do on the weekend?"**  
      - "What **are you doing** on the weekend?"
   
   2. **"I don't like her boyfriend"**  
      - Is grammatically incorrect because verbs like "like" are stative and don't usually take the continuous form.
